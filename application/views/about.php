<p class="font-24 margin-vertical-20 font-italic" style="text-align:justify;">CHAANAN- an association of parent of Persons with Intellectual Disability to aware and sensitize the society about the PwIDD, to stand for their rights, to empower them, to be the voice of PwIDD. The basic theme of the association is NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US. It is result of real efforts and foresight of our founder President S. Amarjit Singh Anand to associate the parents of PwIDD IN 1995. Since 1995, CHAANAN is serving the society and families of PwIDDs and cross disabilities to enrich the lives of persons with disabilities. Honest intensions, clear focus, hard work and restless support to families of PwIDDs is the identity of CHAANAN.

<p class="font-24 margin-vertical-20 font-italic" style="text-align:justify;">A person who is affected with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Down syndrome, Muscular Dystrophy, and Multiple Disability having low I.Q. are covered under PwIDDs. Their needs are same like anybody else. They have psychological needs, aspirations; emotional ups and downs and bonding with other peoples. These needs are first met at home and then in interactions with the society, be it
the friends, teachers, trainers or neighbors. Every parent wants to improve the life but they don’t know where to begin with. It is observed the PwIDDs perform well when they have family support. PwIDDs don’t need to show ‘pity’, they need ‘opportunity’ to enhance their abilities.
