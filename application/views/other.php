<p class="font-24 margin-vertical-20 font-italic">Prejudice, violence, and injustice against The Other have persisted since before recorded time. In our current time, however, we witness not only graphic injustice and death as the result of institutional racism, but also divisiveness, disrespect, and the perpetuation of false narratives that only serve to solidify entrenched differences. Binary paths pitting Us versus The Other can often be seen as easy ones to follow blindly, without thought. Little thinking is involved in choosing a single path, and there may be false comfort in numbers or in following the herd, however misguided the herd mentality may be. In such circumstances little consideration is given to the lived experience of those Others vilified by divisive, disrespectful and violent words and actions. We stand in strong opposition to this false narrative of divisiveness, despair, and perpetuation of hopelessness that is embodied in recent dehumanizing and violent actions towards those who have been marginalized by the color of their skin or the circumstances of their lives.</p>
<p class="font-24 margin-vertical-20 font-italic">We would submit that the choice not to reflect upon the lived experience of those in our society who are marginalized or rejected, not to speak out against violence in all forms against them, dehumanizes each of us. Individually and collectively, we are diminished by the actions of everyone who devalues The Other because we—each of us—are now or could someday be The Other.</p>
<p class="font-24 margin-vertical-20 font-italic">The Chaanan family has always viewed diversity as a strength, difference as opportunity, and understanding the lived experience of individuals and their families who experience developmental, physical, and emotional hardships as our pathway to change, our call to action and advocacy, and our responsibility as global citizens. In so doing we explicitly by our words and actions affirm the rights of those who may be marginalized, demeaned, or harmed because of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, or disability. Further, we encourage individual and visible action. While each of us can voice our rejection of injustice differently—through peaceful protest, through writing or respectful conversation, or through the vote—to allow our voices to remain silent invites complicity and devalues The Other in each of us.</p>
<p class="font-24 margin-vertical-20 font-italic">Misunderstanding, hatred, and violence are dangerous cousins. So are fear and silence. We cannot succumb to either. The individuals who are being harmed, living in fear, or marginalized because of their beliefs, the color of their skin, their gender, their sexual identity, or their neurodiversity depend on us to refute and resist violence and divisiveness towards them, and to take peaceful but decisive action to ensure that their rights, needs, and humanity are respected. We owe it to them, to our own children, and to ourselves to do so.</p>
