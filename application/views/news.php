<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Independence at CCSN: The Center for Children with Special Needs will be hosting a half-day workshop for Transition Teams, Clinicians, Managers, Social Workers and BCBAs working with the Adults with autism and related neurodevelopmental disabilities.</p>
<p>Adult learners in the neurodiverse population require unique attention and consideration when helping them achieve independence with their current and future goals in the real-world. This training will guide the practitioner through the process of planning, using assessment and person-centered practices, setting meaningful goals, and maximizing benefits for the adult and their support team.</p>
<p><strong>Participants will learn how to:</strong></p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Select and utilize assessment for community- based activities.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Prioritize the target areas based on person-centered planning and assessment</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Set meaningful and measurable goals in collaboration with individual’s care system.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Maximum benefit to the adult, their support team, and families.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants will have the opportunity to review assessments onsite, practice using materials, and connect with other colleagues working with this population.</p>
<p><strong>This training will be appropriate for:</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians, social workers, and managers working with Adults with ASD, IDD, and ABI. It will also be applicable to school administration and transition teams planning for students' futures.</p>
<p>Light refreshments will be provided</p>
<p><strong>Type II CEUs will be available for BCBAs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Students who have complex needs, including cognitive, academic, motor, social-emotional, and/or behavioral impairments, often present as puzzles to educators. Conducting assessments that are informative and will guide instruction, as well as delivering programming that appropriately meets the needs of these learners can present with challenges to even the most invested of educators.</p>
<p>This workshop is designed to develop greater competency in assessing and addressing the needs of students with complex needs in the cognitive and academic domains.</p>
<p><strong>Participants will learn how to:</strong></p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Choose what is important to assess within the targeted domain</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Select appropriate evaluation instruments</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Modify assessment, as necessary, to capture the important information</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Use the information obtained to drive instruction and intervention</li>
</ul>
<p>The day will consist of dynamic learning opportunities including discussion of research-based methodologies to choose and modify assessments to better understand learner’s areas of strength and weakness. Participants will have the opportunity to practice choosing and modifying assessments, using assessment results to drive instructional and intervention targets, and modifying instruction/intervention based on assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Given the importance of reading to both academic success and successful functioning in the community, reading interventions that are specifically tailored to students with Autism Spectrum Disorders are critical. This workshop is designed to develop greater competency in addressing the learning profiles of students within this population who have mastered the techniques of decoding text, but struggle with comprehension.</p>
<p>This dynamic learning opportunity will include discussion of research-based methodologies to improve student learning within the broad curriculum domain of reading comprehension skills. More specifically, the essential building blocks of successful reading comprehension will be reviewed including vocabulary, background information, literal comprehension, inferencing, main idea, and the application of cognitive strategies to support reading comprehension. Lesson plans for component reading comprehension skills based on the principles of behavior analysis will be reviewed and participants will have the opportunity to implement plans targeting specific skills in this domain. Participants will have the opportunity to practice data collection and analysis to inform instruction and learn about potential accommodations and modifications for specific learning profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Participants will be able to identify the building blocks of reading comprehension.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Participants will be able to read a lesson plan outlining steps for teaching reading comprehension skills.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Participants will understand the sequential steps that lead to target skill acquisition.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Participants will be able to implement steps within a lesson plan that addresses a component of reading comprehension (e.g., main idea).</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Participants will be able to implement prompting hierarchies for steps within their identified sequence.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Participants will be able to utilize data collection protocols to inform decision making.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li accent"></i>Participants will identify potential accommodations and modifications to lesson plans.</li>
